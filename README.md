Disease Detection in Rice Leaves

# Project Description

In India the economic, political and social stability rely directly yet as 
indirectly on the annual production of rice. 37% of the rice illness is 
because of disease as per the review and Analysis of IRRI 
(International Rice Research Institute), during this consequence, the 
farmer watches out of crop on-time with completely opposite 
treatments against disease. The diseases detection and identification 
in massive field through automatic technique is the helpful because it 
reduces the work of peoples or farmers, conjointly time and value for 
observation and analysis of un-wellness symptoms. This report 
contains approach for identification detection and of rice leaf diseases 
by multiclass SVM. The diseases classification is done by SVM 
classifier and therefore the detection accuracy is improved by 
optimizing the info exploitation. In this proposed system, we are 
using image processing techniques to classify diseases & quickly 
diagnosis can be carried out as per disease. This approach will 
enhance productivity of crops. It includes several steps viz. image
acquisition, image preprocessing, segmentation, features extraction.

We use the classifier trained using the knowledge base for detection and diagnosis of plant leaf 
diseases. To create the knowledge base we used sample images and 
divided it by 80% training and 20% testing. Lastly, classification 
technique is applied in detection the sort of plant disease.
